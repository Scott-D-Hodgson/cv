                    In complete transparency, this online <abbr title="Curriculum Vitae">CV</abbr> was intended as a project to be completed over the Christmas break, 2024, to serve as an online footprint in the new year ahead.  Due to an unforeseen opportunity that presented itself, this site was desired prior to the holidays.  As a result, this is presented for the interim as a <abbr title="Work-in-Progress">WIP</abbr> for the remainder of 2024.  Visit again in the near future for a more complete experience.
