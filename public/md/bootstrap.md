Bootstrap is a popular, open-source framework for building responsive, mobile-first websites and web applications. Developed by Twitter, it provides a collection of ready-made HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components, such as navigation bars, buttons, forms, modals, and grids, which help developers design consistent and visually appealing user interfaces more efficiently. Bootstrapâ€™s grid system is especially powerful for creating layouts that automatically adapt to different screen sizes, making it easier to build responsive sites. With customizable styles and extensive documentation, Bootstrap is widely used for fast prototyping and production-ready web development.
