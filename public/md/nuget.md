NuGet is a package manager for the .NET ecosystem that simplifies the process of incorporating third-party libraries and managing dependencies in .NET applications. Through a central repository, NuGet enables developers to find, install, update, and configure packages directly into their projects, eliminating the need to manually download or update library files. Packages on NuGet often include prebuilt code, tools, or resources that enhance application functionality, such as APIs, utility libraries, or framework extensions. Developers manage packages through Visual Studio or the command line, streamlining development workflows and ensuring projects remain up-to-date with the latest compatible versions of dependencies.
