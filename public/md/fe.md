Front-end refers to the part of a web application or website that users interact with directly. It encompasses everything that users experience visually, including the design, layout, and functionality of a website or app. Front-end development focuses on creating an engaging, intuitive, and responsive user interface (UI) using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Front-end developers ensure that a website is visually appealing, easy to navigate, and performs well across different devices and browsers. They often work closely with designers and back-end developers to integrate user-facing elements with the server-side functionality, ensuring a seamless user experience (UX).
