Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It is designed to be incrementally adoptable, meaning you can use it for small parts of a project or scale it up for complex applications. Vue.js is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of integration with other libraries or existing projects. It provides a reactive data-binding system that updates the view automatically when the underlying data changes. Vueâ€™s component-based architecture encourages the creation of reusable, encapsulated UI elements, and it also supports features like routing, state management, and build tools, making it suitable for both simple and large-scale applications. Its design philosophy emphasizes developer productivity and ease of learning.
