Git is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in source code during software development. Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project simultaneously, maintaining a complete history of changes made to the codebase. Unlike traditional version control systems, Git enables users to work independently in their own local repositories and later merge their changes into a shared repository, facilitating efficient collaboration. It features powerful branching and merging capabilities, allowing developers to experiment with new ideas without affecting the main codebase. Git is widely used in both open-source and enterprise environments, and it serves as the foundation for popular platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, which enhance collaboration through additional tools for issue tracking, project management, and code review.
