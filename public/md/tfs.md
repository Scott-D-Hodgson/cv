TFS (Team Foundation Server) is a version control and project management tool developed by Microsoft to support software development teams in managing their code repositories, builds, releases, and work items. It provides a centralized platform for version control, allowing teams to track changes to source code, collaborate on development, and manage software projects throughout their lifecycle. TFS includes features like work item tracking, automated builds, release management, and reporting. It can be integrated with other tools and technologies to streamline the software development process. TFS is often used in conjunction with Agile methodologies to manage tasks, sprints, and backlogs, improving collaboration and efficiency within development teams. TFS has since evolved into Azure DevOps Server, which offers similar capabilities with enhanced cloud integration.
