Back-end refers to the server-side part of a web application or website, responsible for managing and processing data, as well as handling business logic, database interactions, and application functionality that users don't directly see. It involves writing code that enables the front-end to function properly, often using languages like Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, or C#. The back-end includes databases, servers, APIs, and the core application logic that powers the website or app. Back-end developers ensure that the system is scalable, secure, and performs efficiently, often focusing on data storage, retrieval, and processing to provide a seamless user experience on the front-end.
