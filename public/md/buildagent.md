A Build Agent is a software component or server that is responsible for executing build processes in a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. It automates the process of compiling and packaging code, running tests, and generating build artifacts, ensuring that the latest code changes are integrated and tested efficiently. Build agents are typically part of a larger build management system, such as Jenkins, Azure DevOps, or TeamCity, and can be configured to run on dedicated hardware or in cloud environments. They can be triggered automatically when code changes are pushed to a repository or manually by developers. The primary role of a build agent is to ensure that builds are reproducible, consistent, and delivered in a timely manner, helping teams detect integration issues early in the development cycle.
