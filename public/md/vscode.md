Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft, designed to provide a powerful development environment with a focus on speed and simplicity. It supports a wide range of programming languages through extensions, including JavaScript, Python, C++, and more. VS Code features a rich set of tools for code editing, debugging, version control, and syntax highlighting, with an integrated terminal and support for Git. Its highly customizable interface allows developers to extend functionality via a vast library of extensions, providing support for linters, debuggers, themes, and language servers. Though less feature-rich than its full counterpart, Visual Studio, VS Code is popular for its fast performance, flexibility, and ease of use, making it ideal for both small-scale projects and large codebases.
