YAML, which stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language," is a human-readable data serialization format commonly used for configuration files, data exchange between programming languages, and data storage. Its simplicity and clarity make it easy for both humans and machines to read and write, which has contributed to its popularity in various applications, particularly in DevOps and cloud computing. YAML uses indentation to represent nested structures, such as lists and dictionaries, allowing for a clean and hierarchical representation of data. It supports complex data types, including scalars (strings, numbers), sequences (arrays), and mappings (key-value pairs), while maintaining a minimalistic syntax. Because of these features, YAML is often favored for configuration files in software frameworks and tools, such as Docker Compose and Kubernetes, where easy readability and editing are crucial for developers and system administrators. Overall, YAML serves as a versatile and user-friendly alternative to other data serialization formats like JSON and XML.
