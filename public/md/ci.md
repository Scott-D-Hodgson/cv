Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a shared repository, typically multiple times a day. Each integration is automatically tested through automated builds and tests to detect errors or conflicts early in the development process. By frequently integrating and testing code, CI helps teams identify and resolve issues quickly, ensuring that the codebase remains stable and functional. This approach improves collaboration, reduces integration problems, and enables faster, more reliable delivery of software, making it an essential component of Agile and DevOps methodologies.
