ALM, or Application Lifecycle Management, refers to the processes, tools, and practices used to manage the entire lifecycle of a software application, from initial planning and development to testing, deployment, and maintenance. ALM encompasses a wide range of activities, including requirements management, software development, version control, continuous integration, testing, deployment, and post-release support. It integrates development teams, business stakeholders, and operations teams to ensure that the software meets business needs, is delivered on time, and operates efficiently over its lifecycle. ALM tools like Azure DevOps, Jira, and GitLab help automate, track, and manage these processes to improve collaboration, enhance quality, and ensure that software applications are developed, maintained, and upgraded in a systematic, controlled way.
