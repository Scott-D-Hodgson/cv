The Government of Canada is the federal governing authority of Canada, responsible for making and enforcing laws, delivering public services, and representing the interests of Canadians at home and abroad. It operates under a parliamentary system, with the Prime Minister serving as the head of government and the Governor General representing the monarch as the head of state. The government is divided into three branches: the executive, which includes the Prime Minister and Cabinet; the legislative, which comprises the Parliament of Canada, including the House of Commons and the Senate; and the judicial, which interprets and applies the law through independent courts. The Government of Canada plays a crucial role in managing national policies, economic development, social services, and foreign relations while working to promote the well-being and rights of its diverse population across ten provinces and three territories.
