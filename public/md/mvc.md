MVC, or Model-View-Controller, is a software architectural pattern commonly used in web application development to separate an application into three interconnected components: the Model, the View, and the Controller. The Model represents the data and business logic of the application, managing the retrieval and storage of data, while the View is responsible for displaying the user interface and presenting data to the user. The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, processing user input, updating the Model based on that input, and then refreshing the View to reflect any changes. This separation of concerns promotes organized code structure, enhances maintainability, and facilitates collaboration among developers and designers, making MVC a popular choice for frameworks like ASP.NET MVC, Ruby on Rails, and Angular. By promoting clear boundaries between components, MVC helps streamline development workflows and improve the scalability of applications.
