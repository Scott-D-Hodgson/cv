Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC), now called Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), is a federal government department responsible for overseeing immigration, refugee protection, and citizenship matters in Canada. IRCC manages the country's immigration system, helping to facilitate the arrival of immigrants, provide protection to refugees, and offer programs that support new Canadians in integrating into society. The department also administers the granting of citizenship and ensures the legal and policy frameworks for immigrants, refugees, and citizens are upheld. IRCC plays a crucial role in shaping Canada's immigration policies to promote diversity, economic growth, and humanitarian commitments.
