npm, or Node Package Manager, is a package manager for JavaScript that comes bundled with Node.js, allowing developers to easily install, share, and manage libraries and tools for their projects. It provides access to a vast ecosystem of open-source packages and modules hosted in the npm registry, enabling developers to quickly integrate third-party functionality into their applications. With npm, users can manage dependencies, ensuring that the correct versions of libraries are installed and maintained, and automate tasks through scripts defined in a project's `package.json` file. The simplicity and efficiency of npm make it an essential tool in modern JavaScript development, supporting a wide range of frameworks and libraries, such as React, Angular, and Express, and fostering a collaborative environment where developers can contribute and share their work with the community.
