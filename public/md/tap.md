The Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP) is a programming model in .NET that simplifies writing asynchronous code by using the `Task` class to represent asynchronous operations. TAP allows for more readable and maintainable code by avoiding callback methods, providing a clear structure for handling async operations through `await` and `async` keywords. It is commonly used for non-blocking I/O operations, parallel processing, and optimizing performance in modern applications.
