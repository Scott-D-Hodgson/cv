NPE stands for Non-Production Environment, referring to a set of systems or environments used for development, testing, staging, or quality assurance, as opposed to a Production Environment where live, customer-facing applications run. NPEs are critical for testing new features, performing system checks, and simulating real-world usage without affecting live systems or users. These environments allow developers, testers, and other stakeholders to safely evaluate changes, troubleshoot issues, and validate configurations before deployment to production. NPEs are essential for ensuring the quality, reliability, and security of software before it is made available to end-users.
