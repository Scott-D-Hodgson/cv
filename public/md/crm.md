Change and Release Management (CRM) is a critical process in IT service management that focuses on overseeing the lifecycle of software changes and ensuring their smooth and controlled deployment into production environments. The goal of CRM is to minimize the risks and disruptions associated with changes while maintaining the stability and availability of IT services. Change Management involves assessing, approving, and coordinating changes to software, systems, or infrastructure to avoid service interruptions, while Release Management focuses on planning, scheduling, and managing the deployment of software releases into production. Together, these processes ensure that any modifications or updates are implemented in a structured, predictable way, with proper testing, documentation, and communication throughout the process to ensure the change is successful and aligned with business needs.
