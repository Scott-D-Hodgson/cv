Gherkin Syntax is a domain-specific language used for writing behavior-driven development (BDD) test cases in a human-readable format. It allows stakeholders, including developers, testers, and non-technical team members, to describe software behavior in plain English, which fosters collaboration and understanding among team members. Gherkin Syntax is structured around a set of keywords, including "Given," "When," and "Then," which outline the context, action, and expected outcome of a test scenario. Each scenario is typically formatted as a feature file that outlines a specific functionality of the software, making it easier to develop automated tests using tools like Cucumber or SpecFlow. By providing a clear and concise way to define requirements and acceptance criteria, Gherkin Syntax helps ensure that everyone involved in the project has a shared understanding of the desired functionality.
