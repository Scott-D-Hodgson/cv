LINQ, or Language Integrated Query, is a powerful feature of .NET that allows developers to query and manipulate data directly within their programming languages, such as C# and VB.NET. Introduced by Microsoft, LINQ provides a consistent syntax for working with various data sources, including databases, XML documents, and in-memory collections, enabling seamless integration of query capabilities into the language itself. With its expressive and readable syntax, LINQ simplifies complex data operations, such as filtering, sorting, and grouping, making it easier for developers to work with data without requiring extensive knowledge of the underlying data access technologies. By leveraging LINQ, developers can write more concise, maintainable code while benefiting from compile-time type checking and IntelliSense support, enhancing productivity and reducing runtime errors.
