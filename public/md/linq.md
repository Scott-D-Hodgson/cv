LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a feature in C# and other .NET languages that allows developers to query and manipulate data from different sources, such as collections, databases, and XML, using a consistent syntax. It integrates query capabilities directly into the language, enabling operations like filtering, sorting, and grouping with a more readable and concise code. LINQ supports both in-memory data (like arrays and lists) and remote data sources (like SQL databases) through its various providers.
