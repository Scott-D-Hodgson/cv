Agile is a project management and product development methodology that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer-centricity. Unlike traditional, linear approaches, Agile promotes breaking projects into small, manageable increments, called iterations or sprints, where cross-functional teams work on delivering working solutions in short cycles, typically lasting 1-4 weeks. Agile encourages frequent feedback, continuous improvement, and adapting to changing requirements, allowing teams to respond quickly to market shifts or user needs. This iterative process helps ensure faster delivery, higher quality, and more alignment with stakeholder expectations throughout the project lifecycle.
