JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language and represents data as key-value pairs, similar to objects in JavaScript, or as ordered lists, akin to arrays. JSON's simple structure makes it an ideal format for transmitting data between a server and a client in web applications, particularly in conjunction with AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) for dynamic content updates. Because of its language-agnostic nature, JSON is widely adopted across various programming languages, making it a popular choice for APIs and configuration files. Its readability and efficiency in representing complex data structures have made JSON a standard format in modern web development, facilitating seamless data exchange in applications and services.
