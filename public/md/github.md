GitHub is a web-based platform that facilitates version control and collaboration for software development projects, primarily using Git, an open-source version control system. Launched in 2008, GitHub provides a user-friendly interface for managing repositories, where developers can host, share, and collaborate on code. It features tools for issue tracking, project management, and pull requests, allowing teams to work together efficiently on software development and deployment. GitHub also supports open-source projects, enabling developers to contribute to a vast library of shared code and resources. With its social networking aspects, such as following other users and starring repositories, GitHub fosters a community of developers who share knowledge and innovations in the tech space.
