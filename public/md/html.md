HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used for creating and structuring content on the web. It provides the foundational framework for web pages by defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and multimedia through the use of various tags and attributes. HTML documents are plain text files that browsers interpret to display content in a visually structured format, enabling users to navigate and interact with websites. As a core technology of the World Wide Web, HTML works in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, allowing developers to create rich and dynamic web experiences. Its evolving specifications, including HTML5, introduce new elements and features that enhance multimedia support and improve accessibility and performance on the web.
