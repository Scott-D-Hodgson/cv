A developer is a professional who writes, tests, and maintains code that creates software applications, websites, or systems. They work with programming languages like Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, or others to develop functionality, troubleshoot issues, and ensure the smooth operation of the software they build. Developers typically specialize in either front-end (user interface) or back-end (server-side) development, or sometimes both (full-stack). They collaborate with other team members, including designers, business analysts, and testers, to deliver applications that meet user requirements, solve problems, and operate efficiently. Developers also stay updated with new technologies, programming practices, and frameworks to improve their coding skills and adapt to industry advancements.
