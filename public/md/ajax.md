AJAX, or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, is a technique used in web development to create dynamic, interactive web applications by allowing data to be exchanged between a web server and a client asynchronously, without needing to reload the entire web page. By using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and an API (typically with XML or JSON for data exchange), AJAX enables parts of a page to be updated in response to user actions or server responses in real-time. This improves the user experience by making web applications faster and more responsive, as it reduces the need for full page reloads, resulting in smoother, more efficient interactions on websites and web applications.
