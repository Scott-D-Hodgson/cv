TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds type annotations and other features to the JavaScript language, enabling developers to catch errors early during development. It provides optional type checking, allowing for a more structured and predictable codebase, which can be especially beneficial for large-scale applications. TypeScript code is compiled down to plain JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with existing JavaScript libraries and frameworks. In addition to type safety, TypeScript includes modern JavaScript features like async/await, destructuring, and modules, and integrates well with popular front-end frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue.js. Its tooling and support for editors like VS Code enhance developer productivity by providing features like autocompletion, refactoring, and inline documentation.
