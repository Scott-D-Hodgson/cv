An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines methods and data formats for interacting with a specific application, service, or system. APIs enable developers to access certain functions or data of an application without needing to understand its internal code, creating a bridge between different software systems. For example, a weather app on a smartphone may use an API to retrieve up-to-date weather information from a remote server, without needing to store or generate that data itself. APIs streamline data exchange, enhance integration, and support a wide range of functionalities across platforms and services.
