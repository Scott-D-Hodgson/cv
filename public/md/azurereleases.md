Azure Releases is a feature within Azure DevOps that facilitates the release management process by automating the deployment of applications and services across multiple environments. It allows teams to define, manage, and track the deployment of their software from development through staging to production. Azure Releases provides tools for creating release pipelines, which are automated workflows that handle tasks such as environment provisioning, deployment, approval workflows, and integration with build pipelines. It supports a wide range of deployment targets, including Azure services, on-premises environments, and third-party cloud providers, enabling organizations to deliver software with speed and reliability. With Azure Releases, teams can ensure consistent and repeatable deployments, improve collaboration, and accelerate the delivery of software updates.
