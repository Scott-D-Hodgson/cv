Entity Framework (EF) is an open-source Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for .NET that simplifies database interaction by allowing developers to work with databases using .NET objects. It automatically generates SQL queries based on LINQ (Language Integrated Query) and supports features like change tracking, lazy loading, and migrations. EF can be used with relational databases like SQL Server, SQLite, and PostgreSQL, making it a powerful tool for data-driven applications.
