Entity Framework (EF) is an open-source object-relational mapping (ORM) framework developed by Microsoft for .NET applications, designed to simplify database interactions by allowing developers to work with data in the form of domain-specific objects. EF provides a high-level abstraction over database access, enabling developers to use LINQ (Language Integrated Query) to query and manipulate data without needing to write complex SQL queries. It supports various database systems, facilitates data model creation through code-first or database-first approaches, and includes features like change tracking, lazy loading, and migrations for schema management. By streamlining data access and manipulation, Entity Framework enhances productivity and helps maintain cleaner, more maintainable code in .NET applications.
