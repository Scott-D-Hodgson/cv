OAuth, or Open Authorization, is an open standard for access delegation commonly used for token-based authentication and authorization on the internet. It allows third-party applications to securely access user data without sharing their credentials by using access tokens issued by an authorization server. In a typical OAuth flow, a user grants permission to an application to access their information from another service (like Google, Facebook, or Twitter) without revealing their password. This is achieved through a series of redirects and token exchanges that verify the user's identity and authorization levels. OAuth enhances security by allowing users to revoke access at any time and minimizing the risk of exposing sensitive information, making it widely adopted for enabling secure interactions between different web services and applications.
