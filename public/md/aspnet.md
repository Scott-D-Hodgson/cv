ASP.NET is a web application framework developed by Microsoft that enables developers to build dynamic, data-driven websites, web applications, and services. It is part of the larger .NET platform and allows for the use of multiple programming languages, primarily C# and Visual Basic. ASP.NET provides a rich set of libraries and tools for handling web requests, managing databases, and creating responsive user interfaces. It supports both server-side and client-side development, making it versatile for building scalable, high-performance web applications. With features like built-in security, MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, and integration with modern web standards, ASP.NET is widely used for enterprise-level and cloud-based applications.
