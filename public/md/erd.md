An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the structure of a database, showing how data entities (such as tables) relate to one another within a system. ERDs depict entities, which represent data objects or concepts, along with their attributes, and illustrate the connections or relationships between these entities. These diagrams are crucial in database design, as they provide a clear layout of how information will be stored, accessed, and connected, helping designers and developers understand and organize data requirements before creating the actual database. With ERDs, complex data systems become easier to interpret and maintain, supporting effective database architecture and optimization.
