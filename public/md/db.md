A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. It is designed to manage, store, and retrieve large amounts of structured information efficiently. Databases are typically managed by a Database Management System (DBMS), which provides tools for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data. They can be used for a variety of applications, such as storing customer information, managing inventory, or tracking financial transactions. Databases are structured in tables, rows, and columns, and they can support complex queries, relationships, and transactions. There are various types of databases, including relational databases (e.g., SQL), NoSQL databases for unstructured data, and cloud databases for distributed storage solutions.
