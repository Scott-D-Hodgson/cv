Linux is an open-source operating system kernel that serves as the foundation for various operating systems, collectively known as Linux distributions (distros). Initially developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991, Linux is renowned for its stability, security, and flexibility, making it a popular choice for servers, desktops, embedded systems, and supercomputers. Unlike proprietary operating systems, Linux allows users to view, modify, and distribute its source code freely, fostering a collaborative development environment. The diverse range of distributions—such as Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, and Debian—caters to different user needs, from beginner-friendly interfaces to specialized server setups. Linux supports a wide array of software applications and programming languages, and it is widely used in cloud computing, web hosting, and as the backbone of many internet services, contributing significantly to the global technology landscape.
