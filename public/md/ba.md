A Business Analyst (BA) is a professional who acts as a liaison between stakeholders (such as business leaders, users, and IT teams) to ensure that business needs are effectively translated into technical solutions. They gather, analyze, and document business requirements, workflows, and processes, helping organizations identify opportunities for improvement or automation. A BA typically works with cross-functional teams to define project scope, create functional specifications, and ensure that technology solutions align with business objectives. They also play a key role in problem-solving, ensuring that systems, processes, and solutions meet user needs and contribute to achieving organizational goals. Additionally, a BA may be involved in user acceptance testing, process mapping, and training to ensure smooth project delivery.
