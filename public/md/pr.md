A Pull Request (PR) is a feature used in version control systems, particularly in collaborative platforms like GitHub and GitLab, that allows developers to propose changes to a codebase. When a developer wants to merge their changes from a feature branch into the main branch (or another branch), they create a pull request, which initiates a discussion around the proposed modifications. This process includes reviewing the code, discussing potential issues, and suggesting improvements, making it a crucial part of collaborative software development. Once the changes are approved by other team members or maintainers, the pull request can be merged into the target branch, effectively incorporating the new code into the project. Pull requests enhance code quality and collaboration by facilitating peer review, ensuring that multiple perspectives are considered before changes are finalized.
