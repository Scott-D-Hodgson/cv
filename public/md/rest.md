REST, or Representational State Transfer, is an architectural style for designing networked applications, particularly web services, that relies on a stateless, client-server communication model. RESTful systems use standard HTTP methods—such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE—to perform operations on resources identified by URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). Each resource can be represented in multiple formats, such as JSON or XML, allowing for flexibility in data interchange. REST emphasizes a uniform interface and stateless interactions, meaning each request from a client to a server must contain all the necessary information for the server to fulfill that request without relying on stored context. This simplicity and scalability make REST a popular choice for building APIs that are easy to use, maintain, and integrate with various platforms and services in the modern web development landscape.
