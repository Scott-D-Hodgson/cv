SpecFlow is a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework for .NET that allows teams to define, manage, and automate acceptance criteria for software. Inspired by the Gherkin syntax used in Cucumber, SpecFlow enables writing tests in plain language (such as "Given-When-Then" format), making test cases easily understandable for both technical and non-technical stakeholders. It integrates with various testing tools, including NUnit, MSTest, and xUnit, to run automated tests within the .NET ecosystem. SpecFlow helps teams align on requirements, improve collaboration, and maintain a high standard of test coverage throughout the development process, making it popular for Agile projects focused on continuous delivery.
