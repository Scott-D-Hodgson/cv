Hugo is a fast, open-source static site generator used to create websites quickly and efficiently without the need for a traditional web server. Written in Go, Hugo processes markdown files and template code to generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that make up a complete website. It’s popular for creating static sites, like blogs, portfolios, and documentation, because of its speed and flexibility; it can handle thousands of pages in seconds. Hugo’s robust theming, customization options, and support for content management make it ideal for developers and content creators who need reliable, high-performance sites that can be easily hosted on various platforms without requiring backend infrastructure.
