Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for release to production in a seamless, ongoing manner. The goal is to ensure that software is always in a deployable state, allowing teams to release new features, updates, or bug fixes quickly and reliably. CD builds on the principles of Continuous Integration (CI) by automating further stages, such as deployment, so that new code can be pushed into production with minimal manual intervention. This approach reduces the risks associated with large releases, improves feedback cycles, and enables faster time-to-market, supporting Agile and DevOps methodologies.
