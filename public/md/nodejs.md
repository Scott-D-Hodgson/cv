Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code server-side, outside of a web browser. Built on the V8 JavaScript engine developed by Google, Node.js enables the creation of scalable and high-performance network applications, leveraging an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it particularly well-suited for real-time applications and services that handle numerous simultaneous connections. With its extensive package ecosystem, facilitated by npm (Node Package Manager), developers can easily incorporate third-party libraries and tools to enhance their applications. Node.js is commonly used for building web servers, APIs, and microservices, making it a popular choice for modern web development due to its efficiency, speed, and ability to utilize the same language (JavaScript) for both client-side and server-side development, thereby streamlining the development process.
