Gated Check-in is a software development practice used to ensure that code changes are thoroughly verified before they are merged into the main codebase. When a developer submits a check-in (or commit), the code is automatically subjected to a series of automated checks, such as compiling, running unit tests, and other validation processes, to confirm that the changes do not break the build or introduce errors. Only if the code passes these checks will it be allowed to merge into the repository. This approach helps maintain code quality and stability by preventing incomplete or erroneous code from affecting the main development branch, and it promotes a continuous integration workflow.
