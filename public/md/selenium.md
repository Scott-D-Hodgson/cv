Selenium is an open-source toolset used for automating web application testing across different browsers and platforms. Primarily used by QA engineers and developers, Selenium allows for the creation of automated test scripts in multiple programming languages, including Java, C#, Python, and JavaScript. It includes tools like Selenium WebDriver, which drives browsers to mimic real user interactions, and Selenium Grid, which enables running tests concurrently across multiple machines and browsers for faster execution. This framework is widely used in automated testing to simulate end-user behaviors, ensuring applications function correctly and meet quality standards across varied environments.
