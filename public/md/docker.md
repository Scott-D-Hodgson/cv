Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications within lightweight, portable containers. Containers encapsulate an application and its dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments, whether on a developer's local machine, a testing environment, or in production. Docker simplifies the process of application development by allowing developers to package applications in a standardized format, making them easily deployable across various infrastructure setups. With its robust ecosystem, including Docker Hub for sharing container images and orchestration tools like Docker Compose and Kubernetes for managing multi-container applications, Docker has become an essential tool for modern DevOps practices and microservices architecture.
