PowerShell is a powerful task automation and configuration management framework developed by Microsoft, combining a command-line shell and scripting language built on .NET. Designed for system administrators and developers, PowerShell simplifies and automates complex administrative tasks across Windows, Linux, and macOS environments. It uses cmdlets (command-lets), functions, and scripts that can interact with system resources, software, and cloud platforms, making it ideal for managing servers, applications, and network infrastructure. PowerShell also supports object-oriented programming, enabling users to manipulate data and handle output as structured objects, making it versatile for both scripting and administrative automation across multiple platforms.
