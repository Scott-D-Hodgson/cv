QA (Quality Assurance) refers to the process of ensuring that software, products, or services meet the required standards of quality before being released to the public or clients. It involves systematic activities that focus on preventing defects, identifying issues early in the development process, and improving the overall quality of the final product. In software development, QA typically includes tasks such as planning test cases, performing manual and automated testing, conducting code reviews, and tracking bugs or performance issues. The goal of QA is to deliver a reliable, functional, and user-friendly product by adhering to best practices, guidelines, and industry standards.
