A Tester is a professional responsible for evaluating software or products to ensure they function as intended and meet the required quality standards. In software development, testers design and execute various tests, such as functional, performance, usability, and security tests, to identify bugs, defects, or any other issues within the system. They work closely with developers and quality assurance teams to verify that the software performs well under different conditions, providing feedback and suggesting improvements. The role of a tester is crucial for ensuring that the final product is stable, reliable, and provides a positive user experience. Testers may use both manual testing techniques and automated testing tools to perform their duties.
