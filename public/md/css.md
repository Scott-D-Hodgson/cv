CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and layout of web pages written in HTML or XML. It allows developers to separate content from design, enabling the styling of various elements such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS provides a powerful way to create responsive and visually appealing web designs that can adapt to different screen sizes and devices. With features like selectors, properties, and media queries, CSS allows for precise control over how web content is displayed, making it an essential tool for front-end web development. It also supports advanced techniques like animations and transitions, enhancing user experience on websites.
