GII (GCMS Issues Intake) is a process used by the Government of Canada to manage and track issues or concerns related to the Global Case Management System (GCMS), which is the system used to manage immigration and citizenship applications. It allows individuals or organizations to report problems, errors, or challenges encountered with GCMS, ensuring that these issues are reviewed, addressed, and resolved by the appropriate authorities. The GII system helps maintain the efficiency and accuracy of the GCMS and improves overall service delivery.
