CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment, a set of practices in software development that automates the process of integrating code changes, testing, and deploying applications. Continuous Integration (CI) focuses on frequently merging code changes into a shared repository, followed by automated testing to ensure quality. Continuous Delivery (CD) ensures that the software is always in a deployable state, with automated deployment to production or staging environments for faster and more reliable software delivery.
