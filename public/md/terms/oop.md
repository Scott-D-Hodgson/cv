Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of organizing code around objects, which are instances of classes. It emphasizes four key principles: encapsulation (bundling data and methods), inheritance (reusing code through hierarchical relationships), polymorphism (using a common interface for different data types), and abstraction (hiding complex implementation details). OOP helps in building modular, reusable, and maintainable software systems.
