CIC (Citizenship and Immigration Canada) was the former name of the department responsible for managing immigration, refugee protection, and citizenship processes in Canada. It handled tasks such as visa applications, citizenship applications, and refugee resettlement, aiming to support Canada's immigration policies and integrate newcomers into Canadian society. In 2015, CIC was restructured and became part of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), which continues to oversee these services.
