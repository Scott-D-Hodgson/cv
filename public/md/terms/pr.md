A "PR" (Pull Request) is a feature in version control systems like Git that allows developers to propose changes to a codebase. It enables team members to review, discuss, and approve the modifications before merging them into the main branch. Pull requests promote collaboration, code quality, and ensure that all changes align with project standards and goals.
