Internet Explorer (IE) is a web browser developed by Microsoft, widely used during the late 1990s and early 2000s for accessing and browsing the internet. It supported various web standards and technologies, providing features like tabbed browsing, ActiveX controls, and integration with Windows. Although once dominant, IE has since been succeeded by Microsoft Edge and is no longer actively supported or updated.
