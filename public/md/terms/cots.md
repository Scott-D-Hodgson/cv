COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) refers to ready-made software or hardware products that are available for purchase and can be used without customization. These products are developed for the general market and are designed to meet the needs of a wide range of users, rather than being tailored for specific organizations. COTS solutions are often preferred for their cost-effectiveness, ease of implementation, and broad support, although they may require some adaptation to fit particular business needs.
