A Contribution Agreement (CA) is a formal contract between a government or organization and a recipient that outlines the terms and conditions under which funds or resources are provided to support specific projects or initiatives. It typically includes details on the project's objectives, deliverables, funding amounts, reporting requirements, and any other obligations or expectations for both parties. CAs are commonly used in public sector funding agreements, including those for research, development, or community-focused projects.
