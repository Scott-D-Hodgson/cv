WebDriver is a tool for automating web browsers, providing a programming interface to control and interact with web pages as if a user were navigating them. It is commonly used in testing frameworks like Selenium to perform actions such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, and verifying page content in a browser, simulating real user behavior. WebDriver supports multiple browsers and is designed for cross-browser automation, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments.
