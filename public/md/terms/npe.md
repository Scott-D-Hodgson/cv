NPE (Non-Production Environment) refers to an environment used for developing, testing, and staging applications or systems before they are deployed to production. It allows teams to safely test changes, troubleshoot issues, and validate functionality without impacting live users. NPEs mimic production settings as closely as possible to ensure reliable testing and smooth transitions to the production environment.
