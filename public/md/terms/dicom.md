DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) is a standard for handling, storing, and transmitting medical imaging data, such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. It enables interoperability between different medical imaging devices and systems, ensuring that images and associated data can be easily accessed and shared across healthcare institutions. DICOM also defines protocols for image compression, encryption, and transmission, making it essential for modern healthcare environments to maintain efficient and secure medical imaging workflows.
