YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization format used for configuration files, data exchange, and storing information in a structured way. It is often preferred over JSON for its simplicity and ease of writing, using indentation to represent data hierarchy rather than brackets or commas. YAML is commonly used in DevOps tools, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud configuration for defining settings, parameters, and workflows.
