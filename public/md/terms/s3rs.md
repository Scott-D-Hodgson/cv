S3-RS (Shared Systems Service - Reporting Service) is a centralized, independent software solution designed to handle the processing and generation of reports, separate from the core systems of an organization. By isolating the reporting function, it alleviates other systems from the burden of report generation, ensuring they remain efficient and focused on their primary tasks. S3-RS provides a single, maintainable solution for reporting, improving scalability, security, and overall management of reporting processes across an organization.
