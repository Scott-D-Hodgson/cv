VSS (Visual SourceSafe) is a version control system developed by Microsoft, designed to manage source code and project files in software development teams. It allows developers to track changes, manage file versions, and collaborate by checking files in and out of a central repository. Although widely used in the past, VSS has been replaced by more modern version control systems like Git and Azure DevOps.
