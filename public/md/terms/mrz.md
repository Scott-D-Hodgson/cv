MRZ (Machine-Readable Zone) is a section on identity documents like passports and visas that contains encoded personal information in a standardized format for quick machine processing. Typically located at the bottom of a document, the MRZ includes data such as the holder's name, document number, nationality, and expiration date, represented using OCR-readable characters. This allows for efficient and accurate verification in automated systems, streamlining border control and identity management processes.
