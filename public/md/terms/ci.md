CI (Continuous Integration) is a software development practice where code changes are frequently integrated into a shared repository, often multiple times a day. This practice typically involves automated builds and testing to detect errors early, ensuring that the software remains in a deployable state throughout the development process. CI helps teams identify and fix integration issues quickly, improving code quality and streamlining the development lifecycle.
