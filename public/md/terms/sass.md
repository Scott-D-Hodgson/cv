SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that extends CSS, adding features like variables, nested rules, mixins, and functions to simplify and enhance stylesheet development. It compiles into standard CSS, making it compatible with all web browsers while improving maintainability and reusability of styles. SASS helps developers write cleaner, more organized, and scalable stylesheets for web projects.
