CSI (Corporate Security Intake) is a process or system used by organizations to manage and evaluate security-related requests, incidents, or concerns. It typically involves the submission and tracking of security issues, such as potential threats, breaches, or compliance concerns, to ensure that they are properly assessed, addressed, and resolved. CSI helps streamline communication between employees, security teams, and other stakeholders to enhance organizational safety and security.
