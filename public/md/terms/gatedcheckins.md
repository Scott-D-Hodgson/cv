Gated Check-Ins are a feature in version control systems that ensure code is thoroughly validated before being merged into the main branch. When a developer attempts to check in changes, the system runs automated builds and tests to ensure the code doesn't break the existing functionality or introduce errors. Only if the code passes these validations will the check-in be allowed, ensuring the quality and stability of the codebase.
