NuGet is a package manager for .NET, designed to simplify the process of managing and sharing libraries in .NET applications. It enables developers to easily install, update, and manage dependencies, reducing the complexity of integrating third-party components or sharing custom libraries. NuGet also includes a central repository for discovering packages and supports private repositories for internal development.
