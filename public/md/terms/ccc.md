Crown Copyright Clearance refers to the process by which individuals or organizations seek permission from the government (the Crown) to use, reproduce, or distribute government-owned works, such as publications, documents, and datasets. This clearance ensures compliance with copyright laws, allowing the government to control the use and distribution of its intellectual property. It is typically required when a work is produced by government employees or using public funds.
