SpecFlow is an open-source framework for behavior-driven development (BDD) in .NET, allowing developers to write tests in plain language using the Gherkin syntax (Given, When, Then). It enables collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders by defining application behavior in a readable format that can be easily converted into executable tests. SpecFlow integrates with testing frameworks like NUnit and MSTest, making it a powerful tool for automating acceptance criteria and validating business requirements.
