MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a design pattern used in software development to separate an application into three interconnected components: the Model (data and business logic), the View (user interface), and the Controller (handles user input and updates the model). This separation enhances modularity, making applications easier to manage, test, and scale. MVC is commonly used in web development frameworks like ASP.NET and Ruby on Rails to structure applications efficiently.
