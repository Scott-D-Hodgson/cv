Given-When-Then (GWT) is a structured format used in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) to define the behavior of an application in a clear, readable way. It uses three primary keywords: "Given" to describe the initial state, "When" to specify the action or event, and "Then" to outline the expected outcome. This format helps both developers and non-technical stakeholders understand and verify application functionality.
