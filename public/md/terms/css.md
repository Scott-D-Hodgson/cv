CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML elements on web pages. It allows developers to define visual styles, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning, separating the structure of the content from its design. CSS enhances the user experience by enabling responsive, consistent, and aesthetically pleasing web pages across different devices and screen sizes.
