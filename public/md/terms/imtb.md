IMTB (Information Management and Technologies Branch) was a division within the Government of Canada that focused on managing information technology systems and data, supporting the delivery of digital services across federal departments. It played a critical role in managing IT infrastructure, software solutions, and data systems to ensure effective government operations. In 2012, IMTB was merged with GCMS (Global Case Management System) into a single branch, which was rebranded as SIMB (Solutions and Information Management Branch), aligning IT and information management functions more closely with operational needs.
