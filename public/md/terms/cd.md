CD (Continuous Delivery) is a software development practice that automates the process of deploying code changes to production or staging environments after they pass automated testing. It ensures that code is always in a deployable state, enabling rapid and reliable releases to users. While similar to Continuous Integration (CI), CD extends automation by handling deployment, ensuring faster time-to-market and reducing the risk of errors in production.
