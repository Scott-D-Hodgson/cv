OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for secure authorization that allows third-party applications to access a user's resources on a platform without sharing their credentials. It works by delegating access using tokens, enabling users to grant or revoke permissions without exposing sensitive login information. OAuth is widely used for enabling secure interactions between applications, such as signing in with social media accounts or accessing APIs.
