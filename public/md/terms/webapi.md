WebAPI (Web Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols and tools for building and interacting with web services over the internet. It allows different software applications to communicate by using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to send and receive data, typically in formats such as JSON or XML. WebAPIs are commonly used for building RESTful services and enabling integration between web applications and external systems.
