Grants and Contributions (Gs and Cs) are funding programs provided by the Government of Canada to support organizations, individuals, or communities in achieving specific objectives that align with public policy goals. Grants are non-repayable funds given with minimal reporting requirements, while Contributions are conditional funding agreements requiring detailed accountability for how the money is spent. These programs are used to support areas like community development, innovation, and social services.
