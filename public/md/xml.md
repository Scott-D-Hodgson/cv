XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a flexible, text-based format used to store and transport structured data, allowing users to define their own tags and document structure. It is widely used for representing hierarchical data in a readable format that can be easily shared between systems, such as in web services, configuration files, and data exchange. XML is platform-independent and supports a wide variety of applications, making it essential for data interchange across different technologies.
