XML, or eXtensible Markup Language, is a versatile markup language designed for storing and transporting structured data in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. Unlike HTML, which has predefined tags for displaying content, XML allows users to create custom tags, enabling the representation of complex data structures and hierarchical relationships. This flexibility makes XML widely used for data interchange between systems, configuration files, and the storage of structured information, such as in web services and APIs. XML documents are structured with a set of rules that define the syntax, ensuring that they can be easily parsed and processed by various applications. Its ability to facilitate data sharing across different platforms and programming languages has made XML an essential standard in various domains, including web development, data storage, and enterprise applications.
