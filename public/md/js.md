JS, or JavaScript, is a high-level, dynamic programming language primarily used for enhancing the interactivity and functionality of web pages. Originally developed by Netscape as a client-side scripting language, JavaScript has evolved into a versatile language that can be executed in web browsers and on servers, thanks to environments like Node.js. It enables developers to create responsive user interfaces, manipulate HTML and CSS, handle events, and perform asynchronous operations, making it a cornerstone of modern web development. JavaScript supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, functional, and imperative programming, and has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, which streamline the development of complex applications. With its ability to run on virtually any device with a web browser, JavaScript is an essential tool for building dynamic, interactive, and engaging web experiences.
