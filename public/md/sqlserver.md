SQL Server is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft, designed to store, manage, and retrieve data as requested by other applications. SQL Server uses T-SQL (Transact-SQL), Microsoftâ€™s implementation of SQL, and provides advanced features such as stored procedures, triggers, and views to optimize database functionality and data manipulation. It is popular in enterprise environments for handling large-scale databases, supporting business intelligence, and providing solutions for data integration, reporting, and analytics. SQL Server offers features for performance tuning, data security, and high availability, making it a robust choice for organizations to manage complex data workloads across multiple applications.
