It allows users to perform operations like querying data, updating records, inserting new entries, and deleting data through commands such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. SQL is essential for interacting with and managing data stored in relational database management systems (RDBMS) like MySQL, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.
