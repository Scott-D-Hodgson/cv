SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL provides the ability to create, read, update, and delete data stored in database tables, which are organized in rows and columns. Its core commands, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, allow users to retrieve specific data, modify records, and manage database structures efficiently. SQL supports complex operations, including joining multiple tables, filtering data based on criteria, aggregating results, and defining relationships between tables. Widely used across various database systems like MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL, SQL is fundamental in web development, business analytics, and data science.
